This program is meant to provide a transcription of notes through a microphone. This program uses artificial intelligence to recognize the notes.
The program works best with single melodies with no background noise or tracks. 
The program can detect any pitch, as long as it is clear enough to be recognized through the microphone. This includes playing on an instrument or even humming.
