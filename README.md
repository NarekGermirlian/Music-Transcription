# Project Description 
This program is a tool that provides a transcription of notes given an audio recording, created by the user. This program uses artificial intelligence to recognize the notes, and can be useful to for a variety of reasons:
* Checking the tune of an instrument
* Confirming whether you're singing in tune
* General transcription of a melody

# What I Learned
* **Manipulating data** outputted by **AI models**
* Familiarity with **numpy**
* **File handling**
* Audio programming
  * Analysis of wavelengths

# Instructions to run
To run the program, run main.py. The program will be interacted via the console.
## When it works best
The program works best with slow, single melodies with no background noise or tracks. As a good rule of thumb, if a melody can be hummed clearly, the program will run well.
